## Usage

1. Create a user at https://dev.myuplink.com

2. Create a new application at https://dev.myuplink.com/apps

   Note: We are going to use OAuth's client credentials flow here, so the callback URI will not be used.

3. Profit

   ```shell
   docker run -e CLIENT_ID={your client ID} -e CLIENT_SECRET={your client secret} -e MQTT_SERVER=tcp://test.mosquitto.org:1883 gchri
   ```
   
   Tip: Trying to use localhost? If on Linux, run with `--network=host`. If on MacOS, use `host.docker.internal` for localhost.
